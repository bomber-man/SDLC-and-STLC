## üåÄ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### üìå What is SDLC?
**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used to develop high-quality software systematically. It encompasses all stages from planning to maintenance.

### üîÑ Phases of SDLC

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**
2. **System Design**
3. **Implementation / Coding**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

## üîç Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

### üìå What is STLC?
**STLC** is a sequence of testing activities to ensure software quality, running parallel with SDLC stages.

### üîÑ Phases of STLC

1. **Requirement Analysis**
2. **Test Planning**
3. **Test Case Development**
4. **Test Environment Setup**
5. **Test Execution**
6. **Test Closure**

## üí¨ Top 20 SDLC/STLC Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is SDLC and why is it important?
A structured approach to software development for quality, efficiency, and risk management.

### 2. What are the different phases of the SDLC?
Requirement Gathering, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.

### 3. What is STLC and how is it different from SDLC?
STLC is the testing phase within SDLC; it focuses on quality assurance.

### 4. What are the phases of the STLC?
Requirement Analysis, Planning, Design, Environment Setup, Execution, Closure.

### 5. When does STLC begin in the SDLC process?
During Requirement Gathering phase of SDLC.

### 6. What is the purpose of the Requirement Analysis phase in STLC?
To understand testable items and prepare RTM.

### 7. What is a Test Plan and what does it contain?
It defines testing strategy, scope, schedule, environment, and risk.

### 8. What is the difference between Verification and Validation?
Verification = Building the product right; Validation = Building the right product.

### 9. What are Entry and Exit Criteria in STLC?
Conditions to start/stop testing.

### 10. What is the importance of Test Case Design in STLC?
It ensures comprehensive testing coverage.

### 11. What is the role of RTM in testing?
It maps requirements to test cases ensuring coverage.

### 12. How does SDLC ensure software quality?
Through structured phases, peer reviews, and QA integration.

### 13. What is the Agile SDLC model and how is it different?
Agile is iterative, allows frequent releases and user feedback.

### 14. What challenges can occur during the Testing phase of SDLC?
Time, scope creep, environment issues, data shortages.

### 15. What is Test Environment Setup in STLC?
Configuring hardware, software, DB, and tools for testing.

### 16. What is the purpose of Test Closure?
Wrap-up phase: documentation, metrics, lessons learned.

### 17. How do you ensure traceability in SDLC and STLC?
Using RTM to map requirements, code, and test cases.

### 18. What is the difference between Unit Testing and System Testing in SDLC?
Unit = Module-level; System = Entire application.

### 19. Can development and testing phases overlap in SDLC?
Yes, especially in Agile models.

### 20. What deliverables are produced in SDLC and STLC?
SDLC: SRS, Code, Release Notes. STLC: Test Plans, Reports, RTM.
