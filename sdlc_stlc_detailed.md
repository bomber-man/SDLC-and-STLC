## 🔁 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

---

### 📌 What is SDLC?
**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used by software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It aims to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, within time and cost estimates.

---

### 🌟 Objectives of SDLC
- Provide a structured approach to software development
- Ensure software quality and consistency
- Manage risk, time, and resources effectively

---

### 🔄 Phases of SDLC

#### 1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis
- Stakeholders and analysts gather business requirements
- Feasibility study (technical, financial, operational)
- Output: Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

#### 2. System Design
- High-Level Design (HLD): system architecture, tech stack
- Low-Level Design (LLD): detailed module-level design
- Output: Design documents, database schemas

#### 3. Implementation (Coding)
- Developers write code following design documents
- Follow coding standards, perform unit testing
- Output: Executable software/codebase

#### 4. Testing
- QA team tests the application for bugs and compliance
- Types: Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance
- Output: Bug reports, test result documentation

#### 5. Deployment
- Software is deployed to a production environment
- May involve staged or full deployment
- Output: Released software product

#### 6. Maintenance
- Ongoing updates, bug fixes, enhancements
- Output: Patch releases, updated documentation

---

### 🔍 What is STLC?
**Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)** is a series of well-defined phases performed during the software testing process to ensure software quality goals are met.

---

### 🚀 Objectives of STLC
- Define a systematic approach to software testing
- Ensure full test coverage and defect identification
- Improve quality and reduce post-release issues

---

### 🔄 Phases of STLC

#### 1. Requirement Analysis
- Analyze SRS to identify testable requirements
- Output: Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM), automation feasibility report

#### 2. Test Planning
- Create test strategy, schedule, resources, risk plan
- Output: Test Plan document

#### 3. Test Case Development
- Write test cases/scripts and prepare test data
- Output: Test cases, test scripts, test data sets

#### 4. Test Environment Setup
- Prepare hardware, software, network setup for testing
- Output: Configured test environment

#### 5. Test Execution
- Execute test cases, log actual vs. expected results
- Log and track defects
- Output: Test execution reports, defect logs

#### 6. Test Closure
- Summarize and document test efforts
- Analyze test coverage, defect trends
- Output: Test closure report, lessons learned

### 📊 Comparison: SDLC vs STLC

| Feature         | SDLC                                  | STLC                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Purpose         | Software development                  | Software testing                        |
| Focus           | Entire development life cycle         | Testing activities                      |
| Starts With     | Requirements gathering                | Test requirement analysis               |
| Carried Out By  | Developers, analysts, project managers| QA testers, QA leads                    |
| Deliverables    | Code, documentation, deployment plans | Test plans, test cases, test reports    |
| Outcome         | Working software product              | Verified and validated software         |

### 🔹 Conclusion
SDLC and STLC are integral parts of the software project lifecycle. While SDLC ensures the software is developed effectively and meets the client’s expectations, STLC ensures that the software is thoroughly tested, bug-free, and ready for deployment. Together, they contribute to successful software delivery.
